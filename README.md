## ⚙️ Configuration

### Setup Wizard

The integration provides an easy-to-use setup wizard:

1. **Enter Your Address**
   - Input your address in Taiwan format
   - Example: `新北市板橋區民生路二段80號`

2. **Select Route**
   - The wizard will automatically find nearby garbage truck routes
   - Routes are sorted by distance from your location
   - Select the route that serves your area

3. **Configure Collection Points**
   - **Entry Point**: Truck status changes to "nearby" when arriving at this point
   - **Exit Point**: Truck status returns to "idle" when passing this point
   - Points are automatically suggested based on your location (entry point = nearest point - 1)

### Example Configuration

After setup, the integration creates:

**Binary Sensor**:
- `binary_sensor.trash_tracking_[route_name]_nearby`: ON when truck is near

**Sensor**:
- `sensor.trash_tracking_[route_name]_info`: Detailed truck information
